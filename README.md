# Ternary_plots
This script generates a ternary phase diagram using experimental data from a CSV file. It plots the phase composition of a three-component system (compounds A, B, and C), including phase boundary, tie lines, and a plait point. The visualization helps in understanding phase separation and miscibility regions in the ternary system.
